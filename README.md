## 🎯 Problem Statement

Let ζ(s) be the Riemann zeta function.  
The **Riemann Hypothesis** asserts that:

**All non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2**

This project constructs a formal proof via **Collapse Chains** and **moduli-space-level Ext vanishing**, inspired by categorical reductions and topological triviality.

## 🧠 Proof Strategy: Collapse Chain

We define the collapse sequence:

**PH₁(𝓜_ζ) = 0 ⇒ Ext¹(ℤ, 𝓩_ζ) = 0 ⇒ Sha(ζ) = 0 ⇒ Re(s) = 1/2**

Where:

- **PH₁(𝓜_ζ)**: persistent homology vanishing over the zeta moduli
- **Ext¹**: obstruction class vanishes (cohomological collapse)
- **Sha(ζ)**: global obstructions disappear
- **𝓛_c**: the terminal critical line space, Re(s) = 1/2

## 🔧 Collapse Structure Summary

The layered collapse structure is:

# A-Formal-Collapse-Resolution-of-the-Riemann-Hypothesis-via-AK-Theory

PH₁(𝓜_ζ) = 0
↓
Ext¹(ℤ, 𝓩_ζ) = 0
↓
Sha(ζ) = 0
↓
𝓛_c = {s ∈ ℂ | Re(s) = 1/2}


Each arrow is functorial and governed by axioms A0–A9.

## ✅ Completion Status

This version completes a formal resolution of RH under:

- Collapse axioms (A0–A9)  
- Ext-layer vanishing  
- Topological + categorical obstruction removal  
- Final mapping to Re(s) = 1/2

Thus, formally:

**If PH₁(𝓜_ζ) = 0, then Re(s) = 1/2 for all non-trivial zeros of ζ(s).**

## 🔭 Future Directions

- Extending to generalized L-functions: ζ(s, π)  
- Collapse-motivic interpretation of Langlands functoriality  
- Type-theoretic encoding in Coq/Lean  
- Collapse generalization to functional zeta frameworks
